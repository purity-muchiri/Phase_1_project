# Aviation Risk Analysis Presentation  

## Overview  
This project analyzes aviation accident data to identify the safest aircraft for commercial and private operations. The goal is to reduce investment risks in aviation through data-driven decision-making.  

## Business Understanding  
- The company is expanding into the aviation industry.  
- There is a need to assess aircraft risk before purchasing.  
- **Goal:** Identify low-risk aircraft based on historical accident data.  

## Dataset  
- **Source:** aviation_data
- **Key Features Analyzed:**  
  - Aircraft type  
  - Manufacturer  
  - Geographical regions  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Handling missing values

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Tableau (for visualization)  

## Future Work  
- Expand dataset to improve analysis.  
- Develop a predictive model for risk assessment.  
- Integrate real-time aviation safety reports.

## Conclusion  
Based on our analysis:  
- **Aircraft Type & Manufacturer:** Some aircraft types have significantly higher accident rates.  
- **Geographical Distribution:** Certain regions report more aviation incidents due to weather, regulation, or air traffic.  
- **Trends Over Time:** Aviation safety has improved in recent years, but risks remain for specific aircraft models.
